# Bootstrap

Design framework originally created by Twitter.

Currently on version 4.5.x and used on about 20% of all websites.

Documentation at getbootstrap.com

## Components
### CSS
```html
<link 
  rel="stylesheet" 
  type="text/css" 
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
/>
```

There are also sites that have various themes available for use, such as bootswatch.com.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript libraries are not required for theming.

Depends on jQuery.

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

## Aside
Personally, I try to stick to CSS-only Bootstrap as much as possible.
