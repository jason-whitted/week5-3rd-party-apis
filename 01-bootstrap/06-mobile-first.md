# Mobile First Design
> A mobile-first approach involves designing a desktop site starting with the mobile version, which is then adapted to larger screens.

**Start with mobile!**

## Combining Column Classes
- Start by specifying a `col-#` class
- Add `col-??-#` classes as needed

## Example
```html
<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-xl-3">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
</div>
```
- full-width on mobile devices
- half-width on tablets
- quarter-width on desktops
