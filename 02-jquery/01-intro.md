# jQuery

> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and 
> manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a 
> multitude of browsers.

Originally released in 2006, it revolutionized website development.  Estimates are between 75% and 95% of all websites
used or have used jQuery.  This trend is rapidly declining, especially since in 2013 `querySelector` and 
`querySelectorAll` were added to the DOM.

Although it's not common to see new sites create their website based on jQuery anymore, the chances are very high that
you may need to support existing jQuery code in a production environment.

The jQuery library, by default, is exposed through a globally available `$` function.
